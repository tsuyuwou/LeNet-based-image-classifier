# LeNet-based Image Classifier

In this project, I have developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) for multi-class classification. I am training and testing the performance of my CNN using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CNN architecture that I implemented is a modified version of the LeNet architecture. I have established two goals. The first is to evaluate how noisy images impact the performance of my CNN. This is accomplished by adding noise to the test images and evaluating the accuracy of the CNN’s prediction using several metrics, such as precision, recall, and sparse categorical accuracy. The second goal is to evaluate the performance of my CNN when an autoencoder is used to denoise/reconstruct the original image. My autoencoder is a modified version of the one that can be found in the TensorFlow documentation for autoencoders. I am using four different types of noise in the images, which I refer to as uniform noise, concentrated noise, removing pixels, and random noise. Through testing, I discovered that my CNN performs worse with noisy test images and that an autoencoder’s ability to denoise images is a function of the amount and type of noise applied to the images.
